Today I began work on the side bar for the main page, as well as the main page itself. We had trouble rendering the
sidebar to get it to show on the front page. We think it's due to the obscure libraries used in the template
I used, so tonight I plan on doing further research to find a better template.

Today I further researched how to connect react with bootstrap. I plan do do more work tonight and try to get the sidebar working by EOD tomorrow.

Got the anime detail page to show up, now I am just trying to get the page to show info from the api.

Worked on the anime detail page more, finally fixed the API fetch. For some reason I'm having an issue with the map function.

# Dec 9

Finally got the page to show data from the API! Just had to lay it out and mak it look decent after that. Now I just have to make it redirect you to it from the list once clicked.
