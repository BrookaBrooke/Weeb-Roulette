Today I began work on the side bar for the main page, as well as the main page itself. We had trouble rendering the
sidebar to get it to show on the front page. We think it's due to the obscure libraries used in the template
I used, so tonight I plan on doing further research to find a better template.

Today I further researched how to connect react with bootstrap. I plan do do more work tonight and try to get the sidebar working by EOD tomorrow.

Worked on the anime detail page more, finally fixed the API fetch. For some reason I'm having an issue with the map function.
