Dear Diary:
I think Connor is really cute, but not as cute as John. John has such broad shoulders from carrying the team. We decided that we're going to get Brooke a skimpy dress to present an NFT to the class, and hopefully they are flustered enough to give us a passing grade. Leo and I have actually designed our own AI that is calculating the cure to cancer, but we won't let any of the other group members know about this.

this is a new edit to see if the pipeline stuff goes away.
